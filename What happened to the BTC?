 I bought some Bitcoin at a BTM & got them in a paperwallet that was created by the BTM. Later i tried to move the BTC a wallet, and Blockchain redirected me to a Copay Wallet, so i followed the instructions & was successful it transferring my BTC to the Copay and it said it would take 10 min to appear in my wallet. Now it's hours ago & the BTC still does not show in my wallet. Can anyone help me find my BTC? Thanks, this is worrisome already. is:public
